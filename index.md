## Employment

`01/2016 - now`
_Doctoral Researcher_ at __Institute of Computational Linguistics, Heidelberg University__ (Heidelberg, Germany)

`08/2012 - 07/2013`
_Researcher_ at __ePi Technologies, JSC.__ (Hanoi, Vietnam)

Designed and implemented a MapReduce engine to recommend daily news for users based on their past on-line behavior statistics, such as page
views, page rating and Facebook interactions. The engine was deployed on Amazon EC2 servers. As a team leader of R&D team: Planned and distributed workloads for team members, conducted project meetings, provided technical training for junior staffs.

`08/2012 - 07/2013`
_R&D Coordinator_ at __ePi Technologies, JSC.__ (Hanoi, Vietnam)

Developed a system to recognize named entities for the Vietnamese language based on hand crafted rules. Parts of [the system](https://bitbucket.org/epilab/vnlp/wiki/Home) were released as open-source plugins for GATE. Designed, developed and tested a web-based sentiment analysis system to automatically extract people attitude from documents collected from several sources, such as news, forum discussions, tweets and Facebook statuses. This project was developed for the Vietnamese language and was a major component of a big system which monitors online reputation of brands and individuals.
